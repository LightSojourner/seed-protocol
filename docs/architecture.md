# Technical Architecture
## SEED Protocol System Design

**Status:** ðŸš§ PLANNED  
**Target Phase:** Phase 3 (Collective Synchronization)  
**Fibonacci Term:** 89

---

## Overview

This document will describe the technical architecture for implementing the SEED Protocol, particularly the multi-user synchronization features planned for Phase 3.

---

## Current Status

The SEED Protocol is currently in the **specification and design phase**. Detailed architecture will be developed during Phase 3 implementation (Q1-Q4 2026).

For architectural concepts and plans, see:
- `protocols/seed_004_protocol.json` - Technology Stack section (lines 244-292)
- `protocols/seed_004_research_synthesis.md` - Technical Implementation section

## Planned Architecture Components

### Multi-User Platform
- Real-time data streaming (WebSocket)
- Time synchronization (NTP)
- Distributed processing
- Scalable to 144 participants

### Biofeedback Integration
- EEG device APIs (Muse, OpenBCI)
- HRV sensor protocols (HeartMath, Polar)
- Real-time signal processing
- Multi-modal feedback systems

### Data Layer
- Time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
- Graph database (Neo4j)
- Object storage (S3-compatible)
- End-to-end encryption

### Visualization Engine
- Participant dashboards
- Facilitator controls
- Network topology graphs
- Post-session analysis
