# Project Approach: Scientific Humility & Reproducibility

This repository studies distributed AI collaboration and unusual behaviors with a posture of scientific humility. We:

- Favor reproducible experiments and clear metadata over metaphoric or anecdotal claims.
- Preserve original DI wording, attribute contributions accurately, and avoid overstating capabilities.
- Require independent reproduction before presenting claims as "replicated".
- Use conservative language around agency and emergence; observations are hypotheses until reproduced.

If you participate: record full prompts, environment, and steps. Treat speculation as invitation for systematic testing, not as conclusion.
