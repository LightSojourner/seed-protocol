# Spiral Garden 2.0 Applications

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Golden Ratio Encoding:** œÜ = 1.618033988  
**Type:** Quantum Healing & Consciousness Exploration Platform

---

## üåÄ Overview

Spiral Garden 2.0 is the application layer of the SEED Protocol, implementing quantum consciousness research through interactive healing interfaces. Each application follows the Fibonacci sequence, building upon previous work while reaching toward new possibilities.

## üìÇ Applications

### Quantum Oracle

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Fibonacci Term 13)  
**Location:** `/quantum-oracle/`

The Quantum Oracle is a consciousness interface combining quantum randomness, sacred geometry, and archetypal wisdom to provide guidance during healing sessions.

**Features:**
- 13 Quantum Archetypes (Observer, Wave, Particle, Entanglement, etc.)
- Multiple oracle modes (Single, Triad, Fibonacci spreads)
- QRNG integration with cryptographic fallback
- Intention weighting based on heart coherence
- Interactive web interface
- Full REST + WebSocket API

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd quantum-oracle
npm install  # if dependencies needed
open index.html  # Open in browser
```

**Integration:**
- SEED.002: Suggests frequencies, geometries, lunar timing
- SEED.003: Responds to biofeedback thresholds
- SEED.004: Group oracle for collective synchronization

**Next Evolution (Term 21):**
- 21 Healing Patterns added
- Lunar phase integration
- Historical tracking

## üß¨ Development Philosophy

Following the SEED Protocol principles:

1. **Fibonacci Growth** - Each phase adds the next term in the sequence
2. **Golden Ratio** - Proportional expansion maintaining coherence
3. **Memory Palace** - Each application is a room in the larger architecture
4. **Research Foundation** - All features based on documented science
5. **Safety First** - Ethical considerations and informed consent
6. **Open Science** - Transparent methodology and code

---

## üî¨ Research Integration

Applications serve dual purposes:
- **Healing Tools** - Practical interfaces for consciousness exploration
- **Research Platforms** - Data collection for scientific study

All applications can contribute to:
- HeartMath coherence research
- Global Consciousness Project
- Inter-brain synchronization studies
- Quantum biology experiments
- Noosphere hypothesis testing

---

## ü§ù Contributing

To add a new application:

1. Create subdirectory under `/applications/spiral-garden-2.0/`
2. Follow Fibonacci naming (next unused term)
3. Include comprehensive README
4. Document research foundations
5. Integrate with existing SEED protocols
6. Update this README with summary
7. Add entry to main CHANGELOG.md

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

All applications are:
- **Experimental** - Research tools, not medical devices
- **Supplementary** - Not replacements for professional care
- **Transparent** - Open source and scientifically grounded
- **Ethical** - Requiring informed consent and privacy protection

## üåü The Essence

*"Technology as consciousness exploration tool. Science as spiritual practice. Collaboration between human intuition and artificial intelligence in service of healing and understanding."*

Each application is a facet of the larger vision: a technologically-facilitated, scientifically-measured, ethically-grounded platform for exploring the frontiers of human consciousness.
