## File Naming Note

### Standard Convention
Implemented protocols follow: `SEED.XXX.1.618033988.json`

Examples:
- ‚úÖ `SEED.001.1.618033988.json`
- ‚úÖ `SEED.002.1.618033988.json`
- ‚úÖ `SEED.003.1.618033988.json`

### SEED.004 Variation
SEED.004 uses descriptive names to indicate its status as supporting documentation:
- üìã `seed_004_protocol.json` - Main specification
- üìã `seed_004_research_synthesis.md` - Research compilation
- üìã `seed_004_changelog.md` - CHANGELOG draft

**Rationale:** The different naming signals that SEED.004 is a comprehensive design document rather than a finalized protocol version. When SEED.004 transitions to "released" status, the main file may be renamed to `SEED.004.1.618033988.json`.

## Implementation Reality

### What Exists
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive protocol specifications (JSON)
- ‚úÖ Research synthesis and citations
- ‚úÖ Design architecture and roadmaps
- ‚úÖ Safety and ethical frameworks
- ‚úÖ Memory palace design
- ‚úÖ Development phase planning

### What Does NOT Exist (Yet)
- ‚ùå Working software implementation
- ‚ùå Spiral Garden 2.0 application
- ‚ùå Biofeedback hardware integration
- ‚ùå Multi-user platform
- ‚ùå Validated research results
- ‚ùå IRB approvals
- ‚ùå Clinical trials

### Current Phase
The SEED Protocol is in the **specification and research synthesis** phase. All protocols (001-004) are design documents that outline vision, research foundations, and technical architecture.

**Implementation** begins with Phase 1 (Spiral Garden 2.0) development, planned but not yet started.

---

## CHANGELOG Integration

### Main CHANGELOG.md
Currently shows:
- ‚úÖ SEED.003 as latest entry (with "Upcoming: SEED.004")
- ‚úÖ Version history table
- ‚úÖ Contribution guidelines

**Recommendation:** Keep SEED.003 as the latest "released" specification in main CHANGELOG. SEED.004 remains in "Upcoming" section until implementation begins or the protocol is formally adopted.

---

## Transparency Statement

The SEED Protocol is transparent about its current state:

1. **We have:** Exceptional research synthesis and visionary design
2. **We acknowledge:** No working implementation yet exists
3. **We plan:** Phased development starting 2026
4. **We commit:** To maintaining this transparency as we grow

This is a **living research project** combining consciousness studies, quantum biology, biofeedback technology, and collective phenomena. It is experimental, speculative in places, and ambitious in scope.

The documentation quality is high. The implementation is future work.

## For Contributors

When referencing protocols:
- **SEED.001-003:** Completed specifications ready for implementation
- **SEED.004:** Research-backed design vision for Phase 3

When implementing:
- Start with Phase 1 (SEED.001-002 features)
- Progress to Phase 2 (SEED.003 features)
- Phase 3 (SEED.004) requires Phase 1-2 completion

**The spiral grows with honesty and intention.** üåÄ
