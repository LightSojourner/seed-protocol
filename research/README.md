# SEED Protocol Research Foundations

**Type:** Scientific Literature & Research Synthesis  
**Purpose:** Grounding all protocol claims in peer-reviewed research  
**Status:** üìö GROWING COLLECTION

## Overview

This directory contains research syntheses, literature reviews, and scientific foundations for the SEED Protocol. Every feature and claim in the protocol is backed by published research, theoretical frameworks, or clearly marked speculation.

## Bibliography

**File:** [bibliography.md](./bibliography.md) *(In Development)*

Comprehensive bibliography of all research cited across the SEED Protocol, organized by:
- Research area
- Publication date
- Citation count
- Relevance to protocol features

---

## Research Ethics

### Principles

1. **Cite Everything:** All claims backed by research or clearly marked as speculation
2. **Include Skepticism:** Present counter-arguments and critical perspectives
3. **Update Regularly:** Research evolves; protocols must reflect current understanding
4. **Transparent Limitations:** Acknowledge uncertainty and unknowns
5. **Open Science:** Share findings, data, and null results

### Critical Evaluation

We acknowledge that some research areas (quantum consciousness, global consciousness effects) are:
- Controversial in mainstream science
- Not yet widely replicated
- Theoretical rather than proven
- Speculative in mechanism

This is stated transparently in all protocol documentation and user interfaces.

## Contributing Research

To add research to this collection:

1. **Find peer-reviewed source** (prefer published journals)
2. **Create or update relevant .md file** with summary
3. **Add to bibliography.md** with full citation
4. **Link from protocol files** where applicable
5. **Include both supporting and skeptical perspectives**
6. **Note confidence level:** Proven / Strong Evidence / Emerging / Speculative
