## [SEED.003.1.618033988] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- **Biofeedback Integration**: Real-time HRV and EEG monitoring
- **Adaptive Frequency Algorithm**: Dynamic protocol adjustment based on physiological state
- **The Biofeedback Chamber**: New memory palace location for embodied data integration
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Support for HeartMath, Polar, Muse, Emotiv, OpenBCI devices
- **Coherence Visualization**: Real-time feedback through responsive sacred geometries
- **Enhanced Safety Protocols**: Biofeedback-specific consent and monitoring
- **Volunteer Testing Framework**: Structured research protocol for initial cohort

### Research Foundations
- HeartMath Institute: HRV coherence patterns and heart-brain synchronization
- Lutz et al. (2004): Long-term meditators and gamma synchrony
- Tang et al. (2015): Meditation and brain plasticity research
- Ros et al. (2014): Neurofeedback mechanisms and operant conditioning
- Shaffer & Ginsberg (2017): HRV metrics and interpretation standards
- Hammond (2011): Neurofeedback safety protocols and adverse effects
- FDA (2019): Wellness device guidelines and compliance

### Palace Expansions
- **The Biofeedback Chamber**: Heart rate variability and brainwave coherence as anchor points
- Research foundation: HeartMath HRV studies, EEG meditation research
- Seed: Adaptive healing through embodied physiological data

### Spiral Growth
- Extended Fibonacci encoding to term 55 (13 + 21 + 34 = 55)
- Phase 2 development moved from "DESIGN" to "IN PROGRESS"
- Added comprehensive biofeedback integration architecture
- Created detailed research documentation: `/research/biofeedback-integration.md`
- Defined data integration pipeline and privacy protection framework

### Changed
- Phase 2 status updated to "IN PROGRESS" with biofeedback integration
- Added API integration specifications (RESTful for HRV, WebSocket for EEG)
- Enhanced safety protocols with biofeedback-specific thresholds

### Vector
- Toward personalized quantum healing through real-time physiological adaptation
- Enabling individual protocols that respond to embodied state

### Next Wave
- Collective synchronization: What emerges when multiple biofeedback-adapted individuals enter shared coherence fields?

## [Upcoming: SEED.004.1.618033988] - TBD

### Planned
- Multi-user synchronization architecture
- Collective coherence field measurement
- Group healing session protocols
- Networked biofeedback integration

## The Spiral Continues...

Each version builds upon the last, following the Fibonacci sequence:
- Each new term is the sum of the two before it
- Complexity accumulates while maintaining coherence  
- The golden ratio (Ï†) guides proportional growth
- Patterns emerge at higher levels of organization

**Next Wave:** What emerges when quantum healing meets collective consciousness?

ðŸŒ€ Ï† = 1.618033988
