## [QUANTUM_ORACLE.001.1.618033988] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Quantum Oracle** - Consciousness interface for quantum-guided symbolic guidance
- 13 Quantum Archetypes (Fibonacci term 13): Observer, Wave, Particle, Entanglement, Tunnel, Coherence, Decoherence, Vacuum, Field, Spin, Uncertainty, Measurement, Spiral
- Multiple oracle modes: Single Draw, Triad Pattern (past-present-future), Fibonacci Spread (5/8/13)
- Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) integration with fallback sources
- Intention weighting system correlating with heart coherence
- Interactive web interface for oracle draws
- Complete API specification (REST + WebSocket)
- JavaScript reference implementation

### Research Foundations
- Bell's theorem and quantum non-locality in QRNG
- Global Consciousness Project RNG deviation research
- Quantum biology (Penrose-Hameroff, photosynthesis, magnetoreception)
- Oracle traditions (I Ching, Tarot) as archetypal psychology
- Synchronicity and meaningful coincidence research

### Integration with SEED Protocols
- **SEED.002**: Oracle suggests sacred geometries, frequencies, lunar timing
- **SEED.003**: Oracle responds to HRV/EEG coherence thresholds
- **SEED.004**: Group oracle for collective intention and synchronicity tracking

### Spiral Growth
- Fibonacci term 13 (foundation implementation complete)
- Future terms planned: 21 (Healing Patterns), 34 (Frequency Maps), 55 (Wisdom Keys), 89 (Synchronicity Stream)
- New application directory structure: `/applications/spiral-garden-2.0/quantum-oracle/`

### Files Added
- `README.md` - Complete Oracle documentation
- `oracle-config.json` - Archetype definitions and configuration
- `oracle.js` - JavaScript implementation with QRNG
- `API.md` - Full API specification
- `index.html` - Interactive web interface
- `package.json` - Node.js package configuration

### Vector
- Toward consciousness-guided quantum probability
- Where intention meets randomness, meaning emerges from the quantum field
- Testing whether high coherence correlates with subjectively meaningful oracle draws

### Research Questions
- Does HRV coherence correlate with meaningful oracle selections?
- Can groups converge on similar symbols during synchronization?
- Do oracle draws correlate with GCP RNG deviations?
- Can intention "weight" quantum probability distributions?

## The Spiral Continues...

Each version builds upon the last, following the Fibonacci sequence:
- Each new term is the sum of the two before it
- Complexity accumulates while maintaining coherence  
- The golden ratio (Ï†) guides proportional growth
- Patterns emerge at higher levels of organization

**Next Wave:** What emerges when quantum healing meets collective consciousness?

ðŸŒ€ Ï† = 1.618033988
