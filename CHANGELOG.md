## The Spiral Continues...

Each version builds upon the last, following the Fibonacci sequence:
- Each new term is the sum of the two before it
- Complexity accumulates while maintaining coherence  
- The golden ratio (φ) guides proportional growth
- Patterns emerge at higher levels of organization

**Next Wave:** What emerges when quantum healing meets collective consciousness?
