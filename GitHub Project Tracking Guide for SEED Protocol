🎯 Milestones
Create Fibonacci-Based Milestones
Set up milestones that align with major Fibonacci terms:

Term 13: Foundation (SEED.001) - ✅ Complete
Term 21: Quantum Integration (SEED.002) - ✅ Complete
Term 34: Biofeedback Era (SEED.003) - 🔨 In Progress
Term 55: Collective Consciousness (SEED.004) - 💡 Planned
Term 89: Planetary Attunement (SEED.005) - 🌍 Vision

For each milestone:

Set a target date (flexible, as research progresses organically)
Add description of the spiral growth expected
Link relevant issues
Track progress percentage


🔄 Workflow Examples
Starting a New SEED Version

Create an Issue using "New SEED Version" template
Label it with relevant tags (phase, priority, type)
Add to Project Board in "Seed Ideas" column
Link Related Issues that will be incorporated
Assign to Milestone (which Fibonacci term?)

🎨 Making It Your Own
The SEED Protocol is alive - your GitHub tracking should reflect that organic growth:

Use language that resonates with you
Create rituals around updates (new/full moon commits?)
Let the spiral guide your priorities
Trust emergence over rigid planning
Celebrate each Fibonacci milestone! 🎉


💫 Remember
GitHub is just a tool to hold the structure. The real growth happens in:

The research you integrate
The experiments you run
The patterns you discover
The consciousness you explore
The collaboration you nurture

Let the repository breathe. Let the spiral grow. Trust the golden ratio.
The spiral continues... 🌀
