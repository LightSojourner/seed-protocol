# Contributing to SEED Protocol

**Welcome to the spiral!** üåÄ

We're excited you're interested in contributing to the SEED Protocol. This document provides guidelines for contributing to this open research project.

---

## üéØ Project Status

The SEED Protocol is currently in **design and research specification** phase. We have comprehensive protocol specifications but no working software implementation yet.

**Current Focus:**
- Refining protocol designs (SEED.001-004)
- Building research foundations
- Planning Phase 1 implementation (Spiral Garden 2.0)
- Establishing community and partnerships

---

## üåÄ The Fibonacci Way

Every contribution to SEED Protocol should follow the Fibonacci principle:

> **Each addition is the sum of what came before.**

This means:
1. **Build on existing work** - Don't start from scratch
2. **Maintain coherence** - New features integrate with the whole
3. **Cite foundations** - Back your additions with research
4. **Follow the sequence** - Complexity grows naturally, not arbitrarily

---

## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Research Contributions

**Add to `/research/` directory:**
- Literature reviews and synthesis
- Citations and bibliography entries
- Critical analysis (including skeptical perspectives)
- Research summaries with clear sourcing

**Guidelines:**
- Cite peer-reviewed sources when possible
- Include both supporting and critical perspectives
- Mark confidence levels: Proven / Strong Evidence / Emerging / Speculative
- Link to protocol features that use the research

### 2. Protocol Design

**Enhance protocol specifications:**
- Propose new features for existing protocols
- Design new protocols following Fibonacci sequence
- Improve safety and ethical frameworks
- Expand memory palace locations

**Guidelines:**
- Create a new branch for each SEED iteration
- Document research foundations for all claims
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each protocol version
- Follow the Fibonacci - build on previous work
- Prioritize safety - include warnings and ethical considerations

### 3. Documentation

**Improve `/docs/` and README files:**
- Technical architecture details
- User guides and tutorials
- API documentation (when implemented)
- Explanatory diagrams and visualizations

**Guidelines:**
- Clear, accessible language
- Include examples from actual protocols
- Link to research foundations
- Use diagrams where helpful (Mermaid.js supported)

### 4. Implementation (Future)

**When development begins:**
- Implement Spiral Garden 2.0 (Phase 1)
- Build biofeedback integration (Phase 2)
- Develop multi-user platform (Phase 3)

**Guidelines:**
- Follow existing architecture plans
- Write tests for all features
- Maintain security and privacy standards
- Document code thoroughly
- Follow project code style

---

## üî¨ Research Ethics

All research contributions must:

1. **Cite sources** - Every claim backed by research or marked as speculation
2. **Include skepticism** - Present counter-arguments and critical perspectives
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty** - Be clear about what's proven vs. hypothetical
4. **Maintain transparency** - Disclose limitations and unknowns
5. **Follow open science** - Share methods, data, and null results

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety First

Safety and ethics are core principles:

- Always consider potential harms
- Include appropriate warnings and contraindications
- Respect informed consent requirements
- Protect participant privacy and data
- Follow IRB guidelines for research
- Maintain trauma-informed practices

---

## üìã Contribution Process

### For Small Changes (Documentation, Research)

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Commit with clear messages** (`git commit -m "Add quantum consciousness research summary"`)
5. **Push to your fork** (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
6. **Open a Pull Request**

### For Large Changes (New Protocols, Major Features)

1. **Open an Issue first** to discuss the proposed change
2. **Get feedback** from maintainers and community
3. **Create a design document** if proposing new protocol
4. **Follow the process above** once approach is agreed
